# Dirt Platformer

This is one of my first published games on the internet. I started it when i was 6 years, and it has made a pretty good result! I learned a lot making the game. I followed a video while making the game. You can watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9FzW-m48fn2jlBu_0DRh7PvAt-GULEmd).

You can play all my games(including this one) on my [home page](https://oliver.ypmania.net/games.html).  If you want, you can directly play [the first version of the game](https://oliver.ypmania.net/games/miniplatformer/html.20240316) or the [second version](https://oliver.ypmania.net/games/miniplatformer/html.20240318)(with a joystick).
